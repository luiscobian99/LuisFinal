                <p>I grew up in Southern California, specifically Rosemead, Ca.I grew up un a house with two of my older sisters and my parents. I was the baby of the family, so the attention was always on me. That was until my oldest sister, Monica, let us know that she was pregnant with her first baby. I was going to be an uncle for the first time and was ecstatic. Now, I have two neices, one nephew, and another on the way and my family is bigger than ever. </p>

                <p>When I came to Cal I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Initially, I applied as an interdisciplinary studies major and wante dto continue into the Haas Business Program. However that dream was quickly abandoned when I realized I had to learn calculus and economics. When I was still figuring my major out during my first semester I took a history class about the United States since the Civil War. It was there when my Professor said something that changed the direction of my college career:</p>

                <p>That semester made me fall in love with history. The more I learned,  the more I wanted to share with others. This made me realize that the path I want to go down in life is teaching. Everyone in my immediate family is a teacher, and although I wished to be different I think teaching is truly where I'd be happiest. </p>

                    I also have been writing a blog about comic books and social issues on medium. I have been writing this because of both my love of history and comic book characters. Currently, I am working on analyzing a comic called Batman: Venom in which Batman must face drug addiction and mirrors the "drug epidemic" of the 1990s.
